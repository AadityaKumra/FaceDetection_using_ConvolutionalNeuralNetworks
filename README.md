# FaceRecognition_using_ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks
In this project I have taken a dataset with images of 17 different people including myself and created a Face Recognition model using CNN in python.

Facial Recognition possess the importance to give biometric authentication that is used in different applications especially in security. A stored database of the subjects is manipulated using image processing techniques to accomplish this task. Face recognition is achieved using Deep Learning's sub-field that is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a multi-layer network trained to perform a specific task using classification.

The training of the model will be done by images in the Training folder and for the testing of the model, unseen images will be taken from the testing folder for chicking if the model is able to recognise the face numver for the unseen image.

Since we are reconising unique faces,, the model will have the same number of neurons in the output layer for fully connected ANN classifier.
